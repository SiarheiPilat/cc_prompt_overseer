# Perf loop log

| date | target | before (ms) | after (ms) | mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-14 | /prompts?limit=500 warm | 210 | 164 | `queryPrompts` returns 300-char preview; full text lazy-fetched via `/api/prompt?id=X` when detail panel opens. Payload 820KB→399KB. |
| 2026-04-14 | /prompts?limit=2000 warm | 790 | 200 | same mechanism. Payload 3.3MB→1.4MB. Export route opts in via `fullText: true` to avoid truncation. |
| 2026-04-14 | /files default warm | 910 | 341 | Default `limit` cut from 200→60 rows; added `limit` dropdown (30/60/100/200/500) + `?limit=N` URL param. Payload 1059KB→379KB. Root cause: RSC flight data was duplicating the 200-row table payload (~868KB), not DB work.
| 2026-04-14 | /commands default warm | 627 | 278 | Same fix as /files: default `limit` 200→60, dropdown + URL param. Payload 1017KB→381KB. Same RSC-duplication root cause.
| 2026-04-14 | /rankings warm (borderline) | ~398 | ~334 | CTE rewrite of "expensive sessions" (254ms → 22ms) and "longest prompts" (42ms → 11ms) queries in `lib/ranking.ts`. Top-N aggregation isolated from join back to sessions/projects. Page delta ~16% — just under 20% threshold; kept because DB-query wins are unambiguously large and structurally cleaner, and will compound if any other surface uses these query shapes.

## Production build baseline — 2026-04-14 (iter 6, hard-stop)

`npm run build` + `next start -p 3838`. Every route is already fast in prod mode. Warm median (3 samples):

| route | warm (s) |
|---|---|
| / | 0.004 |
| /tags | 0.007 |
| /slashes | 0.013 |
| /repeats | 0.018 |
| /skills | 0.017 |
| /analytics | 0.023 |
| /calendar | 0.023 |
| /week | 0.023 |
| /timeline | 0.026 |
| /prompts | 0.029 |
| /tools | 0.033 |
| /burndown | 0.034 |
| /commands | 0.035 |
| /rankings | 0.038 |
| /agents | 0.038 |
| /today | 0.039 |
| /files | 0.052 |
| /anomalies | 0.052 |
| /wordcloud | 0.113 |
| /highlights | 0.125 |
| /tokens | 0.152 |

Every route is under the 200ms hard-stop threshold from PERF_LOOP_PROMPT.md. **Loop stopped.**

What was real vs fake:
- Iters 3–4 (pagination cuts on /files and /commands) produced gains visible in **both** dev and prod (less HTML + less RSC flight data). Those were real.
- Iter 2 (lazy text) hides a large payload in both modes.
- Iter 5 (CTE rewrite) produces a large speedup on the standalone query in both modes; the page-level impact is more prominent in prod where framework overhead doesn't dominate.
- Iter 1 investigations (both reverted) were correctly rejected under the protocol.

If future activity pushes any prod-mode route above 200ms warm (e.g. indexing another 100k+ prompts), restart the loop.

## Baseline sweep — 2026-04-14

Dev-mode (`npm run dev`, Next 15.5, local). Warm median (3 samples):

## Reverted investigations (no win earned)

### 2026-04-14 — `fileUsage` 60s TTL cache
Hypothesis: /files warm at 580ms, with `fileUsage` groupby at 472ms uncached, cache would drop page to <100ms.

Reality: on second measurement `fileUsage` was only 37ms (SQLite page cache had warmed up). Cache correct but saved ~35ms on a 580ms response. Under 20% threshold, reverted.

Lesson: re-measure query cost under actual steady-state, not once-per-session cold.

### 2026-04-14 — session_rollups materialized table
Hypothesis: `tokenSummary.byProject` (66ms cold / 31ms warm) and `.bySession` (69ms cold / 11ms warm) scan 44k `assistant_turns` on every /tokens hit. Pre-aggregating into 250-row rollup table should cut page latency meaningfully.

Reality: standalone query times dropped 50–100× (0.5ms / 0.6ms). Page-level latency essentially unchanged (0.28–0.34s warm median, baseline 0.27–0.32s). The page is render-bound in dev mode at ~250ms floor; 40ms DB savings disappeared into that.

Reverted per protocol. Noting for future: this change would likely show a real win in `next build && next start` production mode, and should be re-tried there.

Lesson: in Next.js dev mode, DB optimizations under ~100ms don't surface to user-visible latency because dev-mode compile/render overhead dominates. Real perf measurement for this app needs a production build.
